# 25.11 LAB: Months until payoff
Write a program that reads a loan amount, payment amount, and interest rate as inputs and outputs the number of payments required until the loan is paid. Interest is added to current balance before a payment is applied. Ex: If current balance is $100.00 and the interest rate is 0.02, the new balance is $102.00 before a payment is applied. All values are floats.
